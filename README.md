# FortTune
Multimedia show at the VIII Fort Kaunas-Lithuania

Performance and sound art jam, happening at the VIII Fort in Kaunas, Lithuania. October 15th, 2016.

Uses a Pure Data patch to capture the main frequency component of a microphone, turn that into accurate colour with RGB values and using them to create visuals with Processing and coloured light with DMX fixtures. 

As part of the Kaunas Fortress Association festival, and curated by Evelina Simkute, from Šilainiai Project, this was a performance that took place inside an abandoned Fort (sort of bunker) in Kaunas, at a location with attractive acoustics, enabling sound experimentation.

This sound and light art performance/exhibition experiments with the very special acoustic environment of the 40m-long hall inside the VIII fort.

It starts by exploring or tuning to the natural frequencies of the vault at the Fort. These produce resonances that are transformed into colour lights transposed according to their position in the visible spectrum, which repurpose the place from a war context into an experimental art, creative space.

Along the colouring of the sound and light, public and performers are invited to play and contribute with the acoustic of the chamber, so it can be sampled by the artist, processed and played back to further investigate the acoustic possibilities of the space.

During the performance, musicians joined to create a unique jam experience that included Baltic folk Sutartinės songs by  Aiste Aleckūnaitė and Ruta Kazanavičė, brass player Giedrius Balbieris, and guitar player Mantas Radzvilavičius. The result was an unexpected ephemeral sound that was processed, turned into light and interacted with the acoustic environment, the artists at the Fort.
